# gamemaker-virus
A virus made in a old ass version of GameMaker. 

## Features

 - Lags old PCs
 - Takes control of your mouse and moves it to random positions constantly, ensuring you will not be able to use it!
 - Toggles fullscreen constantly
 - Draws shapes randomly
 - Hurts your eyes if you look at it for too long

## Running
In order to make this annoying to use, we are not going to be including the exact GameMaker version needed to compile this. 

I do know, however, that it is not a new version of gamemaker. The original [website](https://yoyogames.com/) that you could download it from is currently offline.
